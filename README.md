##Running Supp


###Windows

See [Vagrant](VAGRANT.md) or [Docker](DOCKER.md) instructions.

###Linux

You can probably just run `./meteor.sh` though it does some symlinking you probably don't need and your directories will be different.


###Heroku

I havent tried yet but https://github.com/jordansissel/heroku-buildpack-meteor looks like the way to go.
